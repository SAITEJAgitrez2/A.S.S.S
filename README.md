3) Install an IDE (Visual Studio code/ PyCharm)
4) Install specified python modules in requirement.txt files



## Overview
The **Automated Safety Surveillance System** is designed to detect and alert authorities about **trespassing, vehicle crashes, and human falls** in real-time. Using advanced **YOLO-based deep learning models**, this system improves security and reduces response times in **public spaces, workplaces, and transportation**.

## Abstract
This study presents an **automated surveillance system** that detects anomalies using **state-of-the-art YOLO versions (YOLOv7 & YOLOv8)** for **pose estimation and object detection**. The system is integrated with **Telegram messaging services** to provide instant alerts upon detecting potential hazards.  
The results demonstrate **high accuracy** in identifying trespassing, falls, and crashes, making it a **reliable alternative** to manual surveillance.

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Crash Detection** üöóüí•  
- **Human Fall Detection** üèÉ‚¨áÔ∏è  
- **Automated Alerts via Telegram** üì©  
- **Uses YOLOv7 for Pose Estimation & YOLOv8 for Object Detection** üéØ  

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Utilized large-scale datasets like **COCO** for training models.  
2. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Used **pre-trained YOLOv7 & YOLOv8** models to eliminate the need for custom training.  
3. **Real-Time Processing**  
   - Implemented on hardware with **GPU acceleration (CUDA, CUDNN, PyTorch)** for faster detections.  
4. **Alert System Implementation**  
   - Telegram bot sends alerts upon detecting any anomaly using **OpenCV** for image capture.
